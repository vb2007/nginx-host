            <div>
                <p><i>"You should all change your sites and logos in this month to a rainbow to show your acceptance."</i> You know what? Here it is. Here is my honest opinion:</p>
                <p>I'm tired of this fucking month. I'm tired of pride, I'm tired of the faggots, I'm tired about all that bullshit I have to take.</p>
                <p>Waking up to June 1st is like having a lucid nightmare. I open up any social platform, and everything is just filled with rainbow flags. I get pinged on discord servers where I never get any notifications any other time of the year: Not a happy new year, merry christmas, but they feel like that saying <i>happy pride month</i> is an essential.</p>
                <p>I don't go out with my friends to the streets to block traffic & shit while screaming <i>WE'RE STAIGHT</i>. Why can't you all just shut up and live your life like anyone else?</p>
                <p>And I wouldn't even have any problem with gay/bi/trans or any other people. I would quietly pass by any of those people on the street without having a single negative thought about them (like I do with any other people). But here we are, all those faggots go around and scream that they exists.</p>
                <p>I don't care what you identify as, I don't care what gender you love. <b>I would accep you, if you would just shut the fuck up.</b></p>
            </div>
            <hr class="my-2">
            <div>
                <video class="d-block mx-auto" controls src="./asset/media/happy-pride-month.mov" title="Burning the pride flag." alt="Burning the pride flag."></video>
            </div>
            <hr class="my-2">
            <div>
                <p>The site still functions, like it does any other month of the year...</p>
                <p>This "design" will dissapear after the faggots calm down (by the end of June).</p>
                <p>Keep using the site as usual.</p>
